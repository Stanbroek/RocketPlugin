Rocket Plugins allows you to join any locally hosted game by direct IP, host games on any map including [workshop maps](https://steamcommunity.com/app/252950/workshop/) with support for limited and custom game modes and manipulating hosted games through a plethora of configurable settings.  
Rocket Plugins also includes a few experimental ways of automatically making your game reachable from outside of your network, including port forwarding through UPnP and UDP hole punching, based on the [original NAT characterization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN#Original_NAT_characterization_algorithm).
